## Background Problem
This notebook was created to evaluate student grades based on manual input such as name, student ID, and exam score. It serves as a beginner-friendly exercise to understand the basics of variables, input/output, and conditional logic in Python.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Process
1. Missing Values Handling: Checked and ensured no missing data remains after processing.
2. Duplicate Check: Verified if there are any duplicate records (none found).
3. Encoding:
- One-Hot Encoding applied for ITEM TYPE column.
- Frequency Encoding applied for SUPPLIER column.

## Insights
- The dataset is clean with no duplicates or missing values after preprocessing.
- Encoding allows categorical data to be converted into numerical form, making it ready for further analysis or modeling.

## Advice
- Always perform thorough data cleaning before analysis to ensure reliable results.
- Encoding categorical features appropriately can significantly improve the performance of machine learning models.
- Consider exploring sales trends over time and supplier performance for deeper insights.
